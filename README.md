# Computer Vision Course Overview

This repository contains tasks from the "Computer Vision" course. While the assignments have been uploaded, not all of them have been completed yet. Below is a brief overview of the course, its structure, and the assignments.

## Course Description

Have you ever wondered how robots navigate spaces and perform tasks, how search engines index billions of images and videos, how algorithms diagnose medical images for diseases, how self-driving cars see and drive safely, or how Instagram creates filters?

At the core of these modern AI applications are computer vision technologies that perceive, understand, and reconstruct the complex visual world. Computer Vision is one of the fastest-growing and exciting fields in artificial intelligence today. This course introduces fundamental concepts and tasks in computer vision, illustrated with real-world case studies. The program covers classical approaches to Computer Vision, which are foundational for understanding Computer Vision in Deep Learning.

### Content:
- Classical image processing methods
- Tasks such as classification, recognition, and motion estimation in video streams

### Prerequisites:
- Python (numpy, matplotlib)
- Machine learning
- Linear algebra
- Calculus
- Statistics

This course is based on materials from [CS131](https://github.com/StanfordVL/CS131_release).
